34,The Competition for the Harold Washington Library Center: 30th Anniversary Commemoration!,"Chicago Public Library's Harold Washington Library Center opened to the public on October 7, 1991.&nbsp;Join us as we celebrate the 30th anniversary of the opening of the largest municipal library in the U.S.&nbsp;with a program presented by Patrick Steffes of Docomomo/US Chicago.The Harold Washington Library Center (HWLC) is also one of the largest public&nbsp;Postmodern buildings in the world. By the time HWLC opened in&nbsp;1991, Postmodernism would be rapidly falling out of favor as an&nbsp;architectural style, leading to its often-maligned and overlooked&nbsp;place in Chicago architectural history and perception.Unlike the far better known architectural competition for the&nbsp;Chicago Tribune in 1922, the 1988 Chicago central library&nbsp;competition is nearly completely forgotten. This competition,&nbsp;unlike the Tribune, was in no way influential, with none of the&nbsp;losing designs known to have been celebrated, copied, or widely&nbsp;reproduced in books or online in the decades since.Notably, only six architectural firms including Lohan &&nbsp;Associates, Murphy/Jahn, SOM, Ricardo Legoretta and Arthur&nbsp;Erickson would enter in one of the highest profile and lucrative&nbsp;global architectural competitions of the 1980s.In addition to the competition and the winning entry, this&nbsp;presentation will discuss in depth the drastic changesChicago’s South Loop has experienced since the nineteenth&nbsp;century. We will also discuss how HWLC has revitalized this long struggling area.Experience many unknown and unpublished images of South State Street and the South Loop,&nbsp;including never-published photographs showing the&nbsp;current HWLC site and the surrounding area going back more than 100 years.Photo shown above:&nbsp;Harold Washington Library Center proposal submitted by The Chicago Library Team (Murphy / Jahn and Paschen Contractors).

36,"The Art of RAS (Rhyme, Alliteration, Storytelling)","This program, led by poet and author Ashlee Connors,&nbsp;seeks to discuss ways to implement effective techniques in poetry writing specifically rhyme and alliteration. We will dispel the belief that rhyme is bad in poetry or makes you a bad writer and watch an example of what it looks like in performance. We will learn what alliteration is and the effect it has on poetry. Lastly, we will create a word bank either from the example we listened to or where facilitator feels led to tell an important story that revisits us. Participants will get 15 minutes to brainstorm and write as much as they can.&nbsp;If time allows, we will hear some drafts. Ashlee Connors is an award-winning poet, author, editor, and spoken word artist. Her work is a wide eyed exploration of love, mental health, sexuality, and motherhood - the joy of survival and the courage of healing. She is a founding member the Counter Collective, an arts organization dedicated to creating safe spaces for artists and currently serves on the executive committee of the Women of the World Poetry Festival, which aims to highlight and amplify voices of women and non-binary writers across the globe.

116,Adult Book Discussion: Hidden Valley Road,"Join the Clearing Branch for&nbsp;a discussion of Hidden Valley Road by Robert Kolker. Copies of the book are available at the front circulation desk.Don and Mimi Galvin seemed to be living the American dream. After World War II, Don's work with the Air Force brought them to Colorado, where their twelve children perfectly spanned the baby boom: the oldest born in 1945, the youngest in 1965. In those years, there was an established script for a family like the Galvins--aspiration, hard work, upward mobility, domestic harmony--and they worked hard to play their parts. But behind the scenes was a different story: psychological breakdown, sudden shocking violence, hidden abuse. By the mid-1970s, six of the ten Galvin boys, one after another, were diagnosed as schizophrenic. How could all this happen to one family?What took place inside the house on Hidden Valley Road was so extraordinary that the Galvins became one of the first families to be studied by the National Institute of Mental Health. Their story offers a shadow history of the science of schizophrenia, from the era of institutionalization, lobotomy, and the schizophrenogenic mother to the search for genetic markers for the disease, always amid profound disagreements about the nature of the illness itself. And unbeknownst to the Galvins, samples of their DNA informed decades of genetic research that continues today, offering paths to treatment, prediction, and even eradication of the disease for future generations.With clarity and compassion, bestselling and award-winning author Robert Kolker uncovers one family's unforgettable legacy of suffering, love, and hope.How to Attend:This event takes place on Zoom.

214,Film Screening: Burnt Oranges by Silvia A. Malagrino,"From 1976 to 1983 Argentina underwent the most brutal dictatorship of the country's history. To this dayArgentineans are confronting the legacies of the state terrorism of the '70s.Director Silvia Malagrino, in a joint effort with journalist/writer Monica Flores Correa, returns to&nbsp;Buenos Aires to film twenty-two years after leaving Argentina during the so-called “Dirty War.” Vividly&nbsp;depicting contemporary life in the city and recalling events surrounding the time of the military repression in&nbsp;the ’70s, Burnt Oranges presents compelling accounts of resistance and transformation.Burnt Oranges combines a poetic personal narrative with traditional documentary interviews, historical&nbsp;and re-created footage. The narration is based on factual letters written by the director Silvia Malagrino&nbsp;and writer Monica Flores Correa, both friends who fled the country at different times.Fundamental to the film are the voices of members of Argentine human rights organizations: Mothers of the&nbsp;Disappeared, Grandmothers of the Disappeared, HIJOS (Sons and Daughters of the Disappeared), and&nbsp;also governmental figures of the 1976-83 military dictatorship who explain their position. Other witnesses&nbsp;include the former chief editor of the Daily Buenos Aires Herald -Bob Cox, and Alicia Partnoy -a poet and&nbsp;a survivor of torture in a detention center. Together, these voices contribute to our understanding of core&nbsp;questions of human action, the potential for creation and destruction, and the necessity of accountability.Silvia Malagrino is as an international award-winning artist,&nbsp;native of Buenos Aires, Argentina. She is Professor in&nbsp;Photography at The School of Art and Art History of the&nbsp;University of Illinois at Chicago. Malagrino’s practice as an&nbsp;artist is fluid and essentially interdisciplinary. She works with&nbsp;different mediums— photography, digital video, language,&nbsp;light and sound to represent not only issues of historical and&nbsp;cultural interest but also to explore in depth the fancies, the&nbsp;intricacies, and the idiosyncrasies of the personal&nbsp;imagination.How to AttendThis event takes place on Zoom.

558,Whose Lakefront: Chicago's Unceded Native Land  ,"Learn about the history and occupation of Indigenous land by marking the presence of unceded territory in the heart of Chicago’s downtown. The “Whose Lakefront”  project is based on a 1914 lawsuit brought by the Pokagon Band of Potawatomi Indians against Chicago for land along the lakefront. Members of the Pokagon Band, based in Michigan, along with a Native resident of Chicago and non-Native ally will discuss this history and contemporary Native sovereignty as highlighted through a recent public art project marking this unceded territory in the heart of Chicago's downtown.  Panelists include JeeYeun Lee, John Low, Madolyn Wesaw, and Debra Yepa-Pappan. This program is co-sponsored by CPL’s Native American Heritage Committee.

Ten years later, one sister lives with her black daughter in the same southern town she once tried to escape. The other secretly passes for white, and her white husband knows nothing of her past.

704,Feminist Book Club: Bad Feminist,"Join Independence Branch for an online discussion of feminist fiction and non-fiction!Our second title to be discussed will be Roxane Gay's Bad Feminist.&nbsp;&nbsp;""This trenchant collection assembles previously published essays and new work by cultural critic and novelist Gay (An Untamed State). Even though she loves pink, feels nostalgic about the Sweet Valley High series, and lets degrading rap lyrics blast from her car stereo, Gay is passionately committed to feminist issues, such as equal opportunity and pay and reproductive freedom. Writing about race, politics, gender, feminism, privilege, and popular media, she highlights how deeply misogyny is embedded in our culture, the careless language used to discuss sexual violence (seen in news reports of sexual assault), Hollywood's tokenistic treatment of race, the trivialization of literature written by women, and the many ways American society fails women and African-Americans. Gay bemoans that fact that role models like Bill Cosby and Don Lemon urge African-Americans to act like ideal citizens while glossing over institutional problems in the education, social welfare, and justice system that exacerbate racism and poverty. Although Gay is aware of her privilege as a middle-class Haitian-American, she doesn't refrain from advising inner-city students to have higher expectations. Whatever her topic, Gay's provocative essays stand out for their bravery, wit, and emotional honesty."" ---Publisher's WeeklyHow to AttendThis event takes place on Zoom.

Walking through his own house at night, a fifteen-year-old thinks he sees another person stepping through a doorway. Instead of the people who could be there, his mother or his brother, the figure reminds him of his long-gone father, who died mysteriously before his family left the reservation. When he follows it, he discovers his house is bigger and deeper than he knew. The house is the kind of wrong place where you can lose yourself and find things you'd rather not have. Over the course of a few nights, the boy tries to map out his house in an effort that puts his little brother in the worst danger, and puts him in the position to save them . . . at terrible cost.”&nbsp;- from the publisher, Tor.comHow to AttendThis event takes place on Zoom.

754,Adult Book Club:  ﻿Mexican Gothic,"This month, we're reading&nbsp;Mexican Gothic&nbsp;by Silvia Moreno-Garcia.After receiving a frantic letter from her newly-wed cousin begging for someone to save her from a mysterious doom, Noemí Taboada heads to High Place, a distant house in the Mexican countryside. She’s not sure what she will find—her cousin’s husband, a handsome Englishman, is a stranger, and Noemí knows little about the region.Noemí is also an unlikely rescuer: She’s a glamorous debutante, and her chic gowns and perfect red lipstick are more suited for cocktail parties than amateur sleuthing. But she’s also tough and smart, with an indomitable will, and she is not afraid: Not of her cousin’s new husband, who is both menacing and alluring; not of his father, the ancient patriarch who seems to be fascinated by Noemí; and not even of the house itself, which begins to invade Noemí’s dreams with visions of blood and doom.&nbsp;(Goodreads, 2021).&nbsp;How to AttendThis event takes place on Zoom.

811,David Sadowski on Chicago’s Lost Ls ,"Chicago’s system of elevated railways, known locally as the “L,” has run continuously since 1892 and, like the city, has never stood still. It helped neighborhoods grow, brought their increasingly diverse populations together, and gave the famous Loop its name. But today’s system has changed radically over the years. Chicago's Lost ""L""s tells the story of former lines such as Garfield Park, Humboldt Park, Kenwood, Stockyards, Normal Park, Westchester, and Niles Center. It was once possible to take high-speed trains on the L directly to Aurora, Elgin, and Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The L started out as four different companies, two starting out using steam engines instead of electricity. Eventually, all four came together via the Union Loop. The L is more than a way of getting around. Its trains are a place where people meet and interact. Some say the best way to experience the city is via the L, with its second-story view. Chicago’s Lost “L”s is virtually a “secret history” of Chicago, and this is your ticket.Author&nbsp;David Sadowski grew up riding the L all over the city. He is the author of&nbsp;Chicago Trolleys and Building Chicago's Subways and runs the online Trolley Dodger blog.How to Attend:This event will take place live on CPL's YouTube channel. and CPL's&nbsp;Facebook page.&nbsp;You'll be able to ask questions during the event as well!&nbsp;Can't make it to the live stream?

In the late 18th and 19th centuries, there was considerable demand for bird feathers, particularly from exotic birds, for fashion. The feathers are also in demand among fly tiers, which is how Rist, a young American studying music at the Royal Academy of Music and one of the best fly tiers in the world, was compelled to rob the museum. Johnson chases down priceless specimens that were sold by Rist and interviews Rist himself to dive deeper into the obsessive and strange world of fly tiers.Copies of this month's selection will be available 30 days prior to the event at the 6th floor reference desk at Harold Washington Library Center (400 South State Street, Chicago IL, 60605).How to AttendThis event takes place on Zoom.

In 1966, Baltimore is a city of secrets that everyone seems to know--everyone, that is, except Madeline ""Maddie"" Schwartz. Last year, she was a happy, even pampered housewife. This year, she's bolted from her marriage of almost twenty years, determined to make good on her youthful ambitions to live a passionate, meaningful life.  Maddie wants to matter, to leave her mark on a swiftly changing world. Drawing on her own secrets, she helps Baltimore police find a murdered girl--assistance that leads to a job at the city's afternoon newspaper, the Star. Working at the newspaper offers Maddie the opportunity to make her name, and she has found just the story to do it: a missing black woman whose body was discovered in the fountain of a city park lake.  --PublisherHow to AttendThis event takes place on Zoom.

A frightening delinquent before being sent away (his infamies included butchering a neighbor’s cat, torching another neighbor’s garage, and terrorizing the locals with a scary pit bull named Hitler), his return sends Parkland residents into a religiously infused tailspin, which only increases when Stew Pot announces that he experienced a religious awakening in prison. Most neighbors are skeptical of this claim, with one notable exception: Mrs. Motley, a widowed retiree, and the Reeves’s next-door neighbor who loans Stew Pot a Bible, which is seen by Stew Pot and many in the community as a friendly gesture&nbsp;(Goodreads, 2021).&nbsp;How to AttendThis event takes place on Zoom.

After a series of maulings, the villagers call for help is answered by Yuri Trush and his team of tiger inspectors. Now the hunt is on and author John Vaillant takes the reader along every step of the way, from the snow-packed tiger tracks winding through the largest boreal forest on Earth to the echoic halls of the Kremlin, looking for answers to questions about deforestation, natural law, and perhaps the most important: Where and when will The Tiger strike next?Copies of this month's selection will be available 30 days prior to the event at the 6th floor reference desk at Harold Washington Library Center (400 South State Street, Chicago IL, 60605).How to AttendThis event takes place on Zoom.

1289,Adult Book Club: The Starless Sea,"Join the Merlo Branch Adult Book Club for a discussion of&nbsp;The Starless Sea&nbsp;by Erin Morgentern.""Zachary Ezra Rawlins is a graduate student in Vermont when he discovers a rare book hidden in the stacks. As he turns the pages, entranced by tales of lovelorn prisoners, key collectors, and nameless acolytes, he reads something strange: a story from his own childhood. Bewildered by this inexplicable book and desperate to make sense of how his own life came to be recorded, Zachary uncovers a series of clues--a bee, a key, and a sword--that lead him to a masquerade party in New York, to a secret club, and through a doorway to a subterranean library, hidden far below the surface of the earth. What Zachary finds in this curious place is more than just a buried home for books and their guardians--it is a place of lost cities and seas of honey, lovers who pass notes under doors and across time, and of stories whispered by the dead. Zachary learns of those who have sacrificed much to protect this realm, relinquishing their sight and their tongues to preserve this archive, and also those who are intent on its destruction. Together with Mirabel, a fierce, pink-haired protector of the place, and Dorian, a beautiful barefoot man with shifting alliances, Zachary travels the twisting tunnels, darkened stairwells, crowded ballrooms, and sweetly-soaked shores of this magical world, discovering his purpose--in both the rare book and in his own life.""How to AttendThis event takes place on Zoom.

Yet as his career begins to flourish, the carnage of the AIDs epidemic grows around him. One by one, his friends are dying and after his friend Nico’s funeral, the virus circles closer and closer to Yale himself. Soon the only person he has left is Fiona, Nico’s little sister.Thirty years later, Fiona is in Paris tracking down her estranged daughter who disappeared into a cult. While staying with an old friend, a famous photographer who documented the Chicago epidemic, she finds herself finally grappling with the devastating ways the AIDS crisis affected her life and her relationship with her daughter. Yale and Fiona’s intertwining stories take us through the heartbreak of 80’s and the chaos of the modern world, as both struggle to find goodness in the midst of disaster.""How to AttendThis event takes place on Zoom.
