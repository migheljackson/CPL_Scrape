35,"The Art of RAS (Rhyme, Alliteration, Storytelling)","<p>This program, led by poet and author Ashlee Connors,&nbsp;seeks to discuss ways to implement effective techniques in poetry writing specifically rhyme and alliteration. We will dispel the belief that rhyme is bad in poetry or makes you a bad writer and watch an example of what it looks like in performance. We will learn what alliteration is and the effect it has on poetry. Lastly, we will create a word bank either from the example we listened to or where facilitator feels led to tell an important story that revisits us. Participants will get 15 minutes to brainstorm and write as much as they can.&nbsp;If time allows, we will hear some drafts. <strong><br><br>Ashlee Connors</strong> is an award-winning poet, author, editor, and spoken word artist. Her work is a wide eyed exploration of love, mental health, sexuality, and motherhood - the joy of survival and the courage of healing. She is a founding member the Counter Collective, an arts organization dedicated to creating safe spaces for artists and currently serves on the executive committee of the Women of the World Poetry Festival, which aims to highlight and amplify voices of women and non-binary writers across the globe. <br><br><br><strong>How to Attend</strong></p><p>This event takes place on Zoom.

115,Adult Book Discussion: Hidden Valley Road,"<p>Join the Clearing Branch for&nbsp;a discussion of <a id=""ember5968"" data-add-title-link=""2169303126"" href=""/item/show/2169303126""></a><a id=""ember6379"" data-add-title-link=""2235060126"" href=""/item/show/2235060126"">Hidden Valley Road</a> by Robert Kolker. Copies of the book are available at the front circulation desk.</p><p>Don and Mimi Galvin seemed to be living the American dream. After World War II, Don's work with the Air Force brought them to Colorado, where their twelve children perfectly spanned the baby boom: the oldest born in 1945, the youngest in 1965. In those years, there was an established script for a family like the Galvins--aspiration, hard work, upward mobility, domestic harmony--and they worked hard to play their parts. But behind the scenes was a different story: psychological breakdown, sudden shocking violence, hidden abuse. By the mid-1970s, six of the ten Galvin boys, one after another, were diagnosed as schizophrenic. How could all this happen to one family?</p><p>What took place inside the house on Hidden Valley Road was so extraordinary that the Galvins became one of the first families to be studied by the National Institute of Mental Health. Their story offers a shadow history of the science of schizophrenia, from the era of institutionalization, lobotomy, and the schizophrenogenic mother to the search for genetic markers for the disease, always amid profound disagreements about the nature of the illness itself. And unbeknownst to the Galvins, samples of their DNA informed decades of genetic research that continues today, offering paths to treatment, prediction, and even eradication of the disease for future generations.<br><br>With clarity and compassion, bestselling and award-winning author Robert Kolker uncovers one family's unforgettable legacy of suffering, love, and hope.<br><br><strong>How to Attend:<br></strong>This event takes place on Zoom.

To this day<br>Argentineans are confronting the legacies of the state terrorism of the '70s.Director Silvia Malagrino, in a joint effort with journalist/writer Monica Flores Correa, returns to&nbsp;Buenos Aires to film twenty-two years after leaving Argentina during the so-called “Dirty War.” Vividly&nbsp;depicting contemporary life in the city and recalling events surrounding the time of the military repression in&nbsp;the ’70s, <em>Burnt Oranges</em> presents compelling accounts of resistance and transformation.</p><p><em>Burnt Oranges</em> combines a poetic personal narrative with traditional documentary interviews, historical&nbsp;and re-created footage. The narration is based on factual letters written by the director Silvia Malagrino&nbsp;and writer Monica Flores Correa, both friends who fled the country at different times.Fundamental to the film are the voices of members of Argentine human rights organizations: Mothers of the&nbsp;Disappeared, Grandmothers of the Disappeared, HIJOS (Sons and Daughters of the Disappeared), and&nbsp;also governmental figures of the 1976-83 military dictatorship who explain their position. Other witnesses&nbsp;include the former chief editor of the Daily Buenos Aires Herald -Bob Cox, and Alicia Partnoy -a poet and&nbsp;a survivor of torture in a detention center. Together, these voices contribute to our understanding of core&nbsp;questions of human action, the potential for creation and destruction, and the necessity of accountability.<br><br>Silvia Malagrino is as an international award-winning artist,&nbsp;native of Buenos Aires, Argentina. She is Professor in&nbsp;Photography at The School of Art and Art History of the&nbsp;University of Illinois at Chicago. Malagrino’s practice as an&nbsp;artist is fluid and essentially interdisciplinary. She works with&nbsp;different mediums— photography, digital video, language,&nbsp;light and sound to represent not only issues of historical and&nbsp;cultural interest but also to explore in depth the fancies, the&nbsp;intricacies, and the idiosyncrasies of the personal&nbsp;imagination.<br></p><p><strong>How to Attend<br></strong>This event takes place on Zoom.

Always a hub of activity, the library houses over 1.2 million holdings, an award-winning Maker Lab, the renovated Thomas Hughes Children's Library, cutting-edge Teen YouMedia space, dozens of works of art by notable artists, rotating exhibits, music practice rooms, and a beautiful Winter Garden.</p>",https://chipublib.bibliocommons.com/events/614b878c66359037007d8b8f,false,https://chipublib.bibliocommons.com/events/614b878c66359037007d8b8f,2021-10-17,2021-10-17,,15,All Ages,English,Harold Washington Library Center,400 S.

After Estella befriends a pair of young thieves who appreciate her appetite for mischief, the three build a life for themselves on the London streets.

No one knows what the treasure is, or if Santiago will be able to surmount the obstacles in his path. But what starts out as a journey to find worldly goods turns into a discovery of the treasure found within. Lush, evocative, and deeply humane, the story of Santiago is an eternal testament to the transforming power of our dreams and the importance of listening to our hearts (Goodreads, 2021).&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong></strong></p><p><strong>How to Attend</strong><br><strong></strong>This event takes place on Zoom.

The Vignes twin sisters will always be identical. But after growing up together in a small, southern black community and running away at age sixteen, it's not just the shape of their daily lives that is different as adults, it's everything: their families, their communities, their racial identities. Ten years later, one sister lives with her black daughter in the same southern town she once tried to escape. The other secretly passes for white, and her white husband knows nothing of her past. Still, even separated by so many miles and just as many lies, the fates of the twins remain intertwined. What will happen to the next generation, when their own daughters' storylines intersect?<br></p><p>Copies of the book are available at the Woodson Regional Library Adult Reference Desk.</p><p><strong>How to Attend</strong><br>This event takes place on Zoom.

Even though she loves pink, feels nostalgic about the Sweet Valley High series, and lets degrading rap lyrics blast from her car stereo, Gay is passionately committed to feminist issues, such as equal opportunity and pay and reproductive freedom. Writing about race, politics, gender, feminism, privilege, and popular media, she highlights how deeply misogyny is embedded in our culture, the careless language used to discuss sexual violence (seen in news reports of sexual assault), Hollywood's tokenistic treatment of race, the trivialization of literature written by women, and the many ways American society fails women and African-Americans. Gay bemoans that fact that role models like Bill Cosby and Don Lemon urge African-Americans to act like ideal citizens while glossing over institutional problems in the education, social welfare, and justice system that exacerbate racism and poverty. Although Gay is aware of her privilege as a middle-class Haitian-American, she doesn't refrain from advising inner-city students to have higher expectations. Whatever her topic, Gay's provocative essays stand out for their bravery, wit, and emotional honesty."" ---Publisher's Weekly</p><p><strong>How to Attend<br></strong>This event takes place on Zoom.

I am a woman who has hurt as immeasurably as I have loved, a child of God divinely guided by His hand.

When he follows it, he discovers his house is bigger and deeper than he knew. </p><p>The house is the kind of wrong place where you can lose yourself and find things you'd rather not have. Over the course of a few nights, the boy tries to map out his house in an effort that puts his little brother in the worst danger, and puts him in the position to save them . . . at terrible cost.”&nbsp;- from the publisher, Tor.com</p><p><strong>How to Attend<br></strong>This event takes place on Zoom.

She’s not sure what she will find—her cousin’s husband, a handsome Englishman, is a stranger, and Noemí knows little about the region.<br><br>Noemí is also an unlikely rescuer: She’s a glamorous debutante, and her chic gowns and perfect red lipstick are more suited for cocktail parties than amateur sleuthing. But she’s also tough and smart, with an indomitable will, and she is not afraid: Not of her cousin’s new husband, who is both menacing and alluring; not of his father, the ancient patriarch who seems to be fascinated by Noemí; and not even of the house itself, which begins to invade Noemí’s dreams with visions of blood and doom.&nbsp;(Goodreads, 2021).&nbsp;</p><p><strong>How to Attend<br></strong><strong></strong>This event takes place on Zoom.

It helped neighborhoods grow, brought their increasingly diverse populations together, and gave the famous Loop its name. But today’s system has changed radically over the years. <a id=""ember7666"" data-add-title-link=""2318357126"" href=""/item/show/2318357126"">Chicago's Lost ""L""s</a> tells the story of former lines such as Garfield Park, Humboldt Park, Kenwood, Stockyards, Normal Park, Westchester, and Niles Center. It was once possible to take high-speed trains on the L directly to Aurora, Elgin, and Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The L started out as four different companies, two starting out using steam engines instead of electricity. Eventually, all four came together via the Union Loop. The L is more than a way of getting around. Its trains are a place where people meet and interact. Some say the best way to experience the city is via the L, with its second-story view. Chicago’s Lost “L”s is virtually a “secret history” of Chicago, and this is your ticket.</p><p>Author&nbsp;David Sadowski grew up riding the L all over the city.

In the late 18th and 19th centuries, there was considerable demand for bird feathers, particularly from exotic birds, for fashion. The feathers are also in demand among fly tiers, which is how Rist, a young American studying music at the Royal Academy of Music and one of the best fly tiers in the world, was compelled to rob the museum. Johnson chases down priceless specimens that were sold by Rist and interviews Rist himself to dive deeper into the obsessive and strange world of fly tiers.<br><br>Copies of this month's selection will be available 30 days prior to the event at the 6th floor reference desk at Harold Washington Library Center (400 South State Street, Chicago IL, 60605).<br></p><p><strong>How to Attend</strong><br>This event takes place on Zoom.

Sandra Birdswell is a student of climatology with an uncanny ability to sense weather events. She first meets Terrence, a Native man and a professor of climatology, at her university classes. Years later, they are drawn together by the powerful forces of their love, for the Earth, for each other, and their mutual need to seek out the broken links of their family histories.</p><p><strong></strong><strong>How to Attend<br></strong>This event takes place in person.</p><p>The safety and health of our patrons and staff is our priority.

In 1966, Baltimore is a city of secrets that everyone seems to know--everyone, that is, except Madeline ""Maddie"" Schwartz. Last year, she was a happy, even pampered housewife. This year, she's bolted from her marriage of almost twenty years, determined to make good on her youthful ambitions to live a passionate, meaningful life.  Maddie wants to matter, to leave her mark on a swiftly changing world. Drawing on her own secrets, she helps Baltimore police find a murdered girl--assistance that leads to a job at the city's afternoon newspaper, the Star. Working at the newspaper offers Maddie the opportunity to make her name, and she has found just the story to do it: a missing black woman whose body was discovered in the fountain of a city park lake.  --Publisher</p><p><strong>How to Attend<br></strong>This event takes place on Zoom.

1058,Anne Shimojima's Sakura Tales; Stories from Japan,"<p>Anne Shimojima, a third generation Japanese American, has been sharing traditional Japanese folk tales for over thirty years. We invite you to listen to eleven of these -&nbsp;<em>Sakura Tales; Stories from Japan </em>-&nbsp;in&nbsp;an hour long program&nbsp;for teens and adults hosted by the Asian American and Pacific Islander Committee. <em>Sakura</em> is the Japanese word for cherry blossom.<br><br>Folk tales are often forgotten as we grow older. Revisiting and remembering them is a gateway to novel and more enriching experiences and is&nbsp;a beautiful way to commemorate and rekindle the past. By telling the <em>Sakura Tales</em>, Shimojima can feel the connection to her great-grandparents' silkworm farm in Nagano-ken, and she honors the memory of her immigrant grandparents, whose spirit of <em>gaman</em> (perseverance) helped them survive life in a new land.&nbsp;<br><br>Anne became a professional storyteller in 1982. She taught graduate courses in storytelling&nbsp;for National-Louis University and for eight years served on the board of the Wild Onion Storytelling Festival in Chicago.

Most neighbors are skeptical of this claim, with one notable exception: Mrs. Motley, a widowed retiree, and the Reeves’s next-door neighbor who loans Stew Pot a Bible, which is seen by Stew Pot and many in the community as a friendly gesture&nbsp;(Goodreads, 2021).&nbsp;</p><p><strong>How to Attend<br></strong><strong></strong>This event takes place on Zoom.

This is The Tiger—a half-ton, eight-feet long, apex predator who has developed a taste for the humans living in this remote wilderness. After a series of maulings, the villagers call for help is answered by Yuri Trush and his team of tiger inspectors. Now the hunt is on and author John Vaillant takes the reader along every step of the way, from the snow-packed tiger tracks winding through the largest boreal forest on Earth to the echoic halls of the Kremlin, looking for answers to questions about deforestation, natural law, and perhaps the most important: Where and when will The Tiger strike next?</p><p>Copies of this month's selection will be available 30 days prior to the event at the 6th floor reference desk at Harold Washington Library Center (400 South State Street, Chicago IL, 60605).<br></p><p><strong>How to Attend</strong><br>This event takes place on Zoom.

As he turns the pages, entranced by tales of lovelorn prisoners, key collectors, and nameless acolytes, he reads something strange: a story from his own childhood. Bewildered by this inexplicable book and desperate to make sense of how his own life came to be recorded, Zachary uncovers a series of clues--a bee, a key, and a sword--that lead him to a masquerade party in New York, to a secret club, and through a doorway to a subterranean library, hidden far below the surface of the earth. What Zachary finds in this curious place is more than just a buried home for books and their guardians--it is a place of lost cities and seas of honey, lovers who pass notes under doors and across time, and of stories whispered by the dead. Zachary learns of those who have sacrificed much to protect this realm, relinquishing their sight and their tongues to preserve this archive, and also those who are intent on its destruction. Together with Mirabel, a fierce, pink-haired protector of the place, and Dorian, a beautiful barefoot man with shifting alliances, Zachary travels the twisting tunnels, darkened stairwells, crowded ballrooms, and sweetly-soaked shores of this magical world, discovering his purpose--in both the rare book and in his own life.""<br><strong><br>How to Attend<br></strong>This event takes place on Zoom.
