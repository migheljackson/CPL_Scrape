The Quiet Year is a unique game built around map making and community life after a devastating event.

Each week brings questions and decisions driven by luck, omens, and other elements that affect everyone and everything in the fictional community being built.

By the end of the game, players will have collaboratively told the story one year of community life and represented it on a shared map.

185,Whose Lakefront: Chicago's Unceded Native Land  ,"Learn about the history and occupation of Indigenous land by marking the presence of unceded territory in the heart of Chicago’s downtown. The “Whose Lakefront”  project is based on a 1914 lawsuit brought by the Pokagon Band of Potawatomi Indians against Chicago for land along the lakefront. Members of the Pokagon Band, based in Michigan, along with a Native resident of Chicago and non-Native ally will discuss this history and contemporary Native sovereignty as highlighted through a recent public art project marking this unceded territory in the heart of Chicago's downtown.  Panelists include JeeYeun Lee, John Low, Madolyn Wesaw, and Debra Yepa-Pappan. This program is co-sponsored by CPL’s Native American Heritage Committee. JeeYeun Lee is an interdisciplinary artist, writer, and activist whose work explores issues of power, connection, and resistance. Her work has been shown in Chicago, Detroit, Santa Fe, Ohio, Missouri, and France. She has worked with social justice and community-based organizations for over thirty years in immigrant rights, economic justice, LGBTQ issues, and domestic violence.

A citizen of the Pokagon Band of Potawatomi Indians, she also serves Indigenous and other marginalized groups through her work with the American Indian Movement Chapter of Indiana and Kentucky. In addition, she serves on the Interim Coordinating Committee of the Michiana Alliance Against Racist and Political Repression.Debra Yepa-Pappan (Jemez Pueblo/Korean) is a visual artist with international acclaim in the field of contemporary Native American art, a co-founder of the newly formed Chicago based Center for Native Futures, and the Native Community Engagement Coordinator at the Field Museum, where she welcomes Native American guests to the museum and facilitates their visits to collections.

But after growing up together in a small, southern black community and running away at age sixteen, it's not just the shape of their daily lives that is different as adults, it's everything: their families, their communities, their racial identities.

315,Astronomy: The Dark Energy Survey,"Rick Kessler, Research Professor at Kavli Institute for Cosmological Physics (KICP) at the University of Chicago, will discuss the motivation for the Dark Energy Survey (DES), the survey instrument and 6-years of data taking (2013-2018), and some of its results.The Dark Energy Survey is an international, collaborative effort to map hundreds of millions of galaxies, detect thousands of supernovae, and find patterns of cosmic structure that will reveal the nature of the mysterious dark energy that is accelerating the expansion of our Universe. DES began searching the Southern skies on August 31, 2013.According to Einstein’s theory of General Relativity, gravity should lead to a slowing of the cosmic expansion. Yet, in 1998, two teams of astronomers studying distant supernovae made the remarkable discovery that the expansion of the universe is speeding up. To explain cosmic acceleration, cosmologists are faced with two possibilities: either 70% of the universe exists in an exotic form, now called dark energy, that exhibits a gravitational force opposite to the attractive gravity of ordinary matter, or General Relativity must be replaced by a new theory of gravity on cosmic scales.DES is designed to probe the origin of the accelerating universe and help uncover the nature of dark energy by measuring the 14-billion-year history of cosmic expansion with high precision. More than 400 scientists from over 25 institutions in the United States, Spain, the United Kingdom, Brazil, Germany, Switzerland, and Australia are working on the project. The collaboration built is using an extremely sensitive 570-Megapixel digital camera, DECam, mounted on the Blanco 4-meter telescope at Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory, high in the Chilean Andes, to carry out the project.Over six years (2013-2019), the DES collaboration used 758 nights of observation to carry out a deep, wide-area survey to record information from 300 million galaxies that are billions of light-years from Earth. The survey imaged 5000 square degrees of the southern sky in five optical filters to obtain detailed information about each galaxy. A fraction of the survey time is used to observe smaller patches of sky roughly once a week to discover and study thousands of supernovae and other astrophysical transients.The talk will last approximately 45 minutes – 1 hour.Registration via email is required.

343,Feminist Book Club: Bad Feminist,"Join Independence Branch for an online discussion of feminist fiction and non-fiction!Our second title to be discussed will be Roxane Gay's Bad Feminist.&nbsp;&nbsp;""This trenchant collection assembles previously published essays and new work by cultural critic and novelist Gay (An Untamed State). Even though she loves pink, feels nostalgic about the Sweet Valley High series, and lets degrading rap lyrics blast from her car stereo, Gay is passionately committed to feminist issues, such as equal opportunity and pay and reproductive freedom. Writing about race, politics, gender, feminism, privilege, and popular media, she highlights how deeply misogyny is embedded in our culture, the careless language used to discuss sexual violence (seen in news reports of sexual assault), Hollywood's tokenistic treatment of race, the trivialization of literature written by women, and the many ways American society fails women and African-Americans. Gay bemoans that fact that role models like Bill Cosby and Don Lemon urge African-Americans to act like ideal citizens while glossing over institutional problems in the education, social welfare, and justice system that exacerbate racism and poverty. Although Gay is aware of her privilege as a middle-class Haitian-American, she doesn't refrain from advising inner-city students to have higher expectations. Whatever her topic, Gay's provocative essays stand out for their bravery, wit, and emotional honesty."" ---Publisher's WeeklyHow to AttendThis event takes place on Zoom.

Walking through his own house at night, a fifteen-year-old thinks he sees another person stepping through a doorway.

When he follows it, he discovers his house is bigger and deeper than he knew. The house is the kind of wrong place where you can lose yourself and find things you'd rather not have. Over the course of a few nights, the boy tries to map out his house in an effort that puts his little brother in the worst danger, and puts him in the position to save them . . . at terrible cost.”&nbsp;- from the publisher, Tor.comHow to AttendThis event takes place on Zoom.

408,Adult Book Club:  ﻿Mexican Gothic,"This month, we're reading&nbsp;Mexican Gothic&nbsp;by Silvia Moreno-Garcia.After receiving a frantic letter from her newly-wed cousin begging for someone to save her from a mysterious doom, Noemí Taboada heads to High Place, a distant house in the Mexican countryside. She’s not sure what she will find—her cousin’s husband, a handsome Englishman, is a stranger, and Noemí knows little about the region.Noemí is also an unlikely rescuer: She’s a glamorous debutante, and her chic gowns and perfect red lipstick are more suited for cocktail parties than amateur sleuthing. But she’s also tough and smart, with an indomitable will, and she is not afraid: Not of her cousin’s new husband, who is both menacing and alluring; not of his father, the ancient patriarch who seems to be fascinated by Noemí; and not even of the house itself, which begins to invade Noemí’s dreams with visions of blood and doom.&nbsp;(Goodreads, 2021).&nbsp;How to AttendThis event takes place on Zoom.

481,David Sadowski on Chicago’s Lost Ls ,"Chicago’s system of elevated railways, known locally as the “L,” has run continuously since 1892 and, like the city, has never stood still. It helped neighborhoods grow, brought their increasingly diverse populations together, and gave the famous Loop its name. But today’s system has changed radically over the years. Chicago's Lost ""L""s tells the story of former lines such as Garfield Park, Humboldt Park, Kenwood, Stockyards, Normal Park, Westchester, and Niles Center. It was once possible to take high-speed trains on the L directly to Aurora, Elgin, and Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The L started out as four different companies, two starting out using steam engines instead of electricity. Eventually, all four came together via the Union Loop. The L is more than a way of getting around. Its trains are a place where people meet and interact. Some say the best way to experience the city is via the L, with its second-story view. Chicago’s Lost “L”s is virtually a “secret history” of Chicago, and this is your ticket.Author&nbsp;David Sadowski grew up riding the L all over the city. He is the author of&nbsp;Chicago Trolleys and Building Chicago's Subways and runs the online Trolley Dodger blog.How to Attend:This event will take place live on CPL's YouTube channel. and CPL's&nbsp;Facebook page.&nbsp;You'll be able to ask questions during the event as well!&nbsp;Can't make it to the live stream?

Johnson chases down priceless specimens that were sold by Rist and interviews Rist himself to dive deeper into the obsessive and strange world of fly tiers.Copies of this month's selection will be available 30 days prior to the event at the 6th floor reference desk at Harold Washington Library Center (400 South State Street, Chicago IL, 60605).How to AttendThis event takes place on Zoom.

564,Adult Book Discussion: The Lake on Fire,"Join the Clearing Branch for&nbsp;a discussion of The Lake on Fire. Copies of the book are available at the front circulation desk.The Lake on Fire is an epic narrative that begins among 19th century Jewish immigrants on a failing Wisconsin farm. Dazzled by lore of the American dream, Chaya and her strange, brilliant, young brother Asher stow away to Chicago; what they discover there, however, is a Gilded Age as empty a façade as the beautiful Columbian Exposition luring thousands to Lake Michigan’s shore. The pair scrapes together a meager living―Chaya in a cigar factory; Asher, roaming the city and stealing books and jewelry to share with the poor, until they find different paths of escape. An examination of family, love, and revolution, this profound tale resonates eerily with today’s current events and tumultuous social landscape. The Lake on Fire is robust, gleaming, and grimy all at once, proving that celebrated author Rosellen Brown is back with a story as luminous as ever.How to Attend:This event takes place on Zoom.

723,The Quiet Year – Community Storytelling and Mapmaking Game   ," Using gameplay as a means of building community, join the library as we explore and play the critically acclaimed storytelling and cartography game The Quiet Year by designer Avery Alder.  The Quiet Year is a unique game built around map making and community life after a devastating event. Players will use a deck of cards that correspond to weeks of the year, with each card representing one week.  Each week brings questions and decisions driven by luck, omens, and other elements that affect everyone and everything in the fictional community being built.  Each of these elements are then added to a map which takes shape over the course of the year.  By the end of the game, players will have collaboratively told the story one year of community life and represented it on a shared map.  No need for roleplaying game experience to join, though this program is aimed towards teen and adult audiences.How to Attend:This game will take place virtually. You will need to download free Zoom software. Advance registration is required.&nbsp;AccessibilityAutomatic transcription is included in all CPL events using Zoom.

In 1966, Baltimore is a city of secrets that everyone seems to know--everyone, that is, except Madeline ""Maddie"" Schwartz. Last year, she was a happy, even pampered housewife. This year, she's bolted from her marriage of almost twenty years, determined to make good on her youthful ambitions to live a passionate, meaningful life.  Maddie wants to matter, to leave her mark on a swiftly changing world. Drawing on her own secrets, she helps Baltimore police find a murdered girl--assistance that leads to a job at the city's afternoon newspaper, the Star. Working at the newspaper offers Maddie the opportunity to make her name, and she has found just the story to do it: a missing black woman whose body was discovered in the fountain of a city park lake.  --PublisherHow to AttendThis event takes place on Zoom.

She taught graduate courses in storytelling&nbsp;for National-Louis University and for eight years served on the board of the Wild Onion Storytelling Festival in Chicago.

As their lives become more deeply intertwined, Irene finds her once-steady existence upended by Clare, and PASSING becomes a riveting examination of obsession, repression, and the lies people tell themselves and others to protect their carefully constructed realities.Watch Passing, only on Netflix: https://www.netflix.com/title/...SUBSCRIBE: http://bit.ly/29qBUt7How to Attend the Discussion:This discussion takes place on Zoom.

1169,Adult Book Club: The Starless Sea,"Join the Merlo Branch Adult Book Club for a discussion of&nbsp;The Starless Sea&nbsp;by Erin Morgentern.""Zachary Ezra Rawlins is a graduate student in Vermont when he discovers a rare book hidden in the stacks. As he turns the pages, entranced by tales of lovelorn prisoners, key collectors, and nameless acolytes, he reads something strange: a story from his own childhood. Bewildered by this inexplicable book and desperate to make sense of how his own life came to be recorded, Zachary uncovers a series of clues--a bee, a key, and a sword--that lead him to a masquerade party in New York, to a secret club, and through a doorway to a subterranean library, hidden far below the surface of the earth. What Zachary finds in this curious place is more than just a buried home for books and their guardians--it is a place of lost cities and seas of honey, lovers who pass notes under doors and across time, and of stories whispered by the dead. Zachary learns of those who have sacrificed much to protect this realm, relinquishing their sight and their tongues to preserve this archive, and also those who are intent on its destruction. Together with Mirabel, a fierce, pink-haired protector of the place, and Dorian, a beautiful barefoot man with shifting alliances, Zachary travels the twisting tunnels, darkened stairwells, crowded ballrooms, and sweetly-soaked shores of this magical world, discovering his purpose--in both the rare book and in his own life.""How to AttendThis event takes place on Zoom.
